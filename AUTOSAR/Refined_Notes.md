# Getting Started with AUTOSAR

## What is AUTOSAR?

- AUTOSAR stands for **AUTomotive Open System ARchitecture**.
- It is a **global partnership** between automotive manufacturers, suppliers, and software/tool/semiconductor providers.
- The primary goal is to **standardize automotive software architecture** to ensure portability, reusability, and interoperability across the industry.

## Why AUTOSAR?

- Addresses the increasing **complexity of electrical/electronic systems (E/E)** in modern vehicles.
- Enables **software reuse and exchangeability** between different partners.
- Promotes **standardization** of interfaces, development workflows, and data exchange formats.

## ECU Count in Modern Vehicles

| Vehicle Type    | Typical ECU Count |
| --------------- | ----------------- |
| Basic vehicles  | ~30–40 ECUs       |
| Luxury vehicles | 100+ ECUs         |

------

## AUTOSAR Consortium

- The consortium includes:
  - **OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers)**
  - **Tier 1 suppliers**
  - **Tier 2 suppliers**
  - **Tool providers**
- These members contribute to the development, maintenance, and adoption of the AUTOSAR standard.

------

## Automotive Industry Roles

### OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer)

- Produces the final vehicle and defines system requirements.
- Examples: BMW, Toyota, Honda

### Tier 1 Suppliers

- Deliver complete ECUs and application-layer software.
- Integrate the AUTOSAR Basic Software (BSW) stack.
- Examples: Bosch, Valeo, Denso, Magna, ETAS

### Tier 2 Suppliers

- Provide software modules, BSW stacks, hardware (e.g., MCUs), and development tools.
- Categories:
  - **BSW implementation providers**: Vector, Elektrobit, Siemens
  - **Semiconductor companies**: STMicroelectronics, Infineon, Texas Instruments
  - **Tool providers**: MathWorks, ETAS

# AUTOSAR Software Architecture

## Layered Architecture

### Application Layer

- Contains interconnected **Software Components (SWCs)** that implement application logic.
- Represents the highest layer in the AUTOSAR stack.

### Runtime Environment (RTE)

- Middleware layer between the Application and BSW.
- Provides communication between:
  - SWC-to-SWC
  - SWC-to-BSW modules
- Contains **only dynamic code**; other modules may include both static and dynamic code.

### Basic Software (BSW)

Divided into three main sublayers:

#### 1. Microcontroller Abstraction Layer (MCAL)

- Lowest level in the stack.
- Provides direct access to the microcontroller hardware via drivers.
- Examples of drivers: ADC, PWM, DIO, Communication, Memory
- MCU-dependent; developed by semiconductor vendors.

#### 2. ECU Abstraction Layer

- Interfaces with MCAL.
- Abstracts hardware layout from the upper layers.
- Provides a standardized API for peripheral and device access.

#### 3. Services Layer

- Offers system-wide services such as:
  - Operating system functionality
  - Network communication and management
  - Diagnostic services
  - Memory services
  - ECU state management
  - Error detection and handling

------

## Complex Device Drivers (CDD)

- Used when a required functionality is not covered by standard BSW modules.
- Sits vertically between RTE and hardware, bypassing standard layers.
- Example: implementation for ISOBUS

------

## Software Modules

- Each AUTOSAR module can include both **static** and **dynamic** code.
- The RTE is unique in that it only contains **dynamic code**.
- Example: Flash driver module provides APIs such as `Fls_Write(ID, Data)` which can be invoked via `RTE_WriteBlock()`.

------

## Libraries in AUTOSAR

- Contain related utility functions, reusable across layers.
- Can be used by SWCs, BSW modules, integration code, or other libraries.
- Execute in the context of the calling entity.
- Example: CRC library

------

## Communication Flow (CAN Example)

### Transmission Flow

1. SWC sends signal to RTE.
2. RTE sends signal to COM module.
3. COM sends Protocol Data Unit (PDU) to PduR.
4. PduR routes the PDU to CanTp (for segmentation if PDU > 8 bytes).
5. CanTp reassembles and passes to PduR.
6. PduR passes data to CanIf.
7. CanIf interfaces with CAN Driver to transmit on the bus.

### Reception Flow

1. CAN Driver receives PDU from the bus.
2. Forwards to CanIf.
3. CanIf passes data to CanTp.
4. CanTp segments/reassembles PDU.
5. Passes to PduR.
6. PduR forwards to COM.
7. COM delivers signal to RTE.
8. RTE delivers to SWC.

# AUTOSAR Workflow Overview

### General Flow

1. **OEM**:
   - Designs the vehicle’s system and network architecture.
   - Supplies the ECU extract.
2. **Tier 1 Supplier**:
   - Implements the application layer software.
   - Integrates the ECU using AUTOSAR stack and configuration tools.
3. **Tier 2 Supplier**:
   - Provides BSW modules, MCAL, libraries, and development tools.
4. **Service Providers**:
   - Support OEMs and Tier 1s in software development, integration, and testing.

### Role Summary

| Role     | Responsibility                             |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| OEM      | Network design, ECU extract, integration   |
| Tier 1   | Application development, ECU integration   |
| Tier 2   | AUTOSAR stack development, MCU drivers     |
| Services | Application support, toolchain, validation |

------

## Benefits of AUTOSAR

- **Hardware abstraction** allows software portability across platforms.
- **Layered design** enables parallel development and easier integration.
- Promotes **software reuse**, improving development speed and reliability.
- Enables **tool-based configuration and code generation**, reducing manual errors.
